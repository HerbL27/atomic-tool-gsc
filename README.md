## Atomic Tool
Black Ops II GSC Injector for CFW.

## What is it?
A small tool that I've been working on for a little while now. Nothing special really. It basically allows you to inject and switch to and from GSC mods for Black Ops II. Just like any other GSC tool.

Except this downloads the latest database that contains all the GSC mods you see the in the app stored on a private server. So, there's no need for you to update the app when there's new mods available, they're downloaded to your Documents folder. I will constantly be updating the database with more mods, let me know if you want to see any specific ones on there.
