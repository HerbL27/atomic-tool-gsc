## Add Your Own Mods
Adding your gsc mods is simple, but requires a few things first. Please ensure that you've already opened the app previously so that the database directories can be installed to your Documents, and that your desired gsc mods are compiled, preferably using [GSC Studio by iMCSx](https://gscstudio.imcsx.co). When you're ready to go, browse to Documents\Atomic Tool GSC and select either of the folders three folders, create a new folder for your mods (any name) and copy your gsc files inside it (no folders, only the files that make up the gsc which must be named to their appropriate gsc, e.g. '_development_dvars.gsc', 'rank_.gsc', etc. That's it, restart the app if it's already open and it will find them.

Alternatively, you can request for them to be uploaded to the server for others to access/use. Just open an issue and I'll put it up.
